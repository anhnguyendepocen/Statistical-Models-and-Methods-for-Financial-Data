# Statistical Models and Methods for Financial Data

## Course Description: 
This course will cover the statistical models and methods that are relevant to financial data analysis. These include modeling and estimation of heavy tailed distributions, modeling and inference with multivariate copulas, linear and non-linear time series analysis (e.g., GARCH and its variations), and statistical portfolio modeling and analysis. Time permitting, optional topics include stochastic volatility models. Exam- ples and data from financial applications will be used to motivate and illustrate the methods.
